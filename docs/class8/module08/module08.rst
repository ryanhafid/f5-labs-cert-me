Lab 8 - Networking
=====================

You have already done a number of labs around networks and there are
only so many things we can do in the lab environment. Will take a moment
to do a couple of simple exercises that will help set up later labs.

301a Objectives covered: 
   - 2.01-2.02
       - Distinguish between the management interface configuration and application
         traffic interface configuration
       - Given a network diagram, determine the appropriate network and system
         settings (i.e., VLANs, self-IPs, trunks, routes, NTP servers, DNS servers,
         SNMP receivers and syslog servers) 

Estimated completion time: **30 minutes**
