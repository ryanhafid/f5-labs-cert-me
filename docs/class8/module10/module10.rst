Lab 10 - Device Service Clusters and High Availability
========================================================

In this module you will configure BIG-IPs for high availability.  Device Service Clusters (DSCs) are a series of BIG-IPs (up to 8) that and support each other and failover applications.

301a Objectives covered: 
   - 2.05-2.07
       - Given a scenario, determine an appropriate high availability
         configuration (i.e., failsafe, failover and timers)
       - Given a scenario, describe the steps necessary to set up a device
         group, traffic group and HA group
       - Predict the behavior of an LTM device group or traffic groups in a
         given failure scenario

Estimated completion time: **45 minutes**
