**Overview  202 - Pre-Sales Fundamentals**

|

Welcome to the F5 202 - Pre-Sales Fundamentals Study Guide. The purpose
of this guide is to help you prepare for the F5 202 - Pre-Sales
Fundamentals exam. The contents of this document are based on the F5 202
- Pre-Sales Fundamentals Exam Blueprint for TMOS v13.1.

**This study guide provides students with some of the basic
foundational knowledge required to pass the exam.**

**This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a
completely original work.** 

I would like to give recognition to a group of people that helped with this
document. A special thank you goes out to Mickey Woods with Ingram Micro,
Ed Rabago with F5, Leif Rasmussen with F5, Orlando Santiago with F5,
Patrick Oswalt from F5, Greg Godar with F5 and Mark Diminico with F5.

The majority of the information is compiled from F5 sources that are
located on the Internet. All of the information locations are referenced
at the top of each topic instead of in an appendix of this document.
This was done to help the reader access the referenced information
easier without having to search through a formal appendix.

The F5 101 - App Delivery Fundamentals exam, stands as a pre-requisite
to this exam.

This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5
document and is *not* supported by F5.
