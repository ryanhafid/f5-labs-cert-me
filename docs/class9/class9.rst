**Overview 301B - LTM Specialist: Maintain and Troubleshoot**

|

Welcome to the 301b - LTM Specialist compiled Study Guide. The purpose of this
guide is to help you prepare for the F5 301b - LTM Specialist exam. The
contents of this document are based on the 301b - LTM Specialist Exam Blueprint
for TMOS v11.5.
 
**This study guide provides students with some of the basic foundational
knowledge required to pass the exam.**

*This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a completely
original work.* The majority of the information is compiled
from F5 sources that are located on Internet. All of the information
locations are referenced at the top of each topic instead of in an
Appendix of this document. This was done to help the reader access the
reference the linked information easier without having to search through
a formal appendix. This guide may also reference the same books as the
exam Resource Guide for each topic when applicable for consistency.

F5 provides the 301b - LTM Specialist Resource Guide as a study
guide. The Resource Guide is a list of reading material that will help
any student build a broad base of general knowledge that can assist in
not only their exam success but in becoming a well rounded systems
engineer. The Resource Guide will be available to the candidate once
they are qualified for the 301b - LTM Specialist exam.

Taking certified F5 LTM training, such as Administering BIG-IP v11 and
Configuring BIG-IP LTM v11, will surely help with the topics of this
exam but does not teach directly to the exam content. Hands on
administrative experience with the BIG-IP platform licensed with LTM
will reinforce many of the topics contained in the 301b - LTM Specialist
exam.

The F5 301a - Local Traffic Manager Specialist: Architect, Setup and
Deploy, stand as a pre-requisite to this exam.

This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5
document and is *not* supported by F5.

**Reading = Knowledge = Power**

**Printed References**

These reference books are important and should be considered basic
reading material for this exam. However, these reading materials are not
available for purchase. You can only gain access to the books by
attending the associated F5 training class. These official F5
classes are now being offered in v12 and v13. So, if you have the newer
copy of the material that is fine, be aware that the exam is based on
the 11.5 version and content could have changed. It is possible that an
ATC for F5  may still offer older 11.5 training, but this is not
guaranteed.
