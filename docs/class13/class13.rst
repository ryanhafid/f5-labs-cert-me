**Overview 303 - BIG-IP ASM Specialist**

Welcome to the 303 - BIG-IP ASM Specialist compiled Study Guide. The purpose of
this guide is to help you prepare for the F5 303 - BIG-IP ASM Specialist exam.
The contents of this document are based on the F5 303 - BIG-IP ASM Specialist
Exam Blueprint for TMOS v12.1.
 
**This study guide provides students with some of the basic foundational
knowledge required to pass the exam.**

*This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a completely
original work.* The majority of the information is compiled from F5 sources
that are located on Internet. All of the information locations are referenced
at the top of each topic instead of in an Appendix of this document. This was
done to help the reader access the reference the linked information easier
without having to search through a formal appendix.

The F5 Certified BIG-IP Administrator (F5-CA), which is made up of the 101 -
App Delivery Fundamentals and 201 - TMOS Administration exams, stand as a
pre-requisite to this exam. 

Taking certified F5 BIG-IP ASM training, such as Configuring BIG-IP ASM v12,
will surely help with the topics of this exam but does not teach directly to
the exam content. Hands on administrative experience with the BIG-IP platform
licensed with BIG-IP ASM will reinforce many of the topics contained in the
303 - BIG-IP ASM Specialist exam.
 
This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5 document
and is *not* supported by F5.

**Reading = Knowledge = Power**

**Printed References**

These referenced books are and important and should be considered basic readin
material for this exam.
