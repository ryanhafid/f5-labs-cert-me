Modify and Troubleshoot Virtual Servers
---------------------------------------

Troubleshooting virtual servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Where would you start?*

I would go on the BIG-IP and test connectivity from the BIG-IP to the
pool members.

*Q2. Attempt to ping one of the pool members. Does it work? What does
this tell you?*

The ping should be successful. This means the server IP is up and I have
basic connectivity.

*Q3. Attempt a* **curl -i** *against a pool member. Does it work? What does
this tell you?*

The curl should be successful and you should see the request come back.
The application is running.

*Q4. Since the problem affects all pool members, what would you suspect
as a possible issue?*

Since I can see all pool members are functioning I would suspect the
monitor is the issue. You could start debugging the monitor directly, or
you could put the default HTTP monitor and see if the pool members
come up. If they do, then the monitor is the issue and needs correction.
You would check the Send and Receive strings. I would use a
curl -i (to include the header and response codes) to look for the
receive string. If you cannot find the receive string then you will have to alter the receive to something that is returned in the page.  In this case the Receive String *f5 vlab demo* is not the response (the monitor is not case sensitive), but *f5 vlab* is, so you can simply delete *demo*.

.. Note:: 

   The default HTTP monitor usually, but does not always, work on an HTTP application.

*Q5. Did you correct the issue?* 

Yes

*Q6. Now the pool is working and purple\_vs is available can you access
the page through the virtual?*

No

*Q7. What do you think would be the next step in debugging the issue
would be?*

I would clear the virtual server statistics and try again and see if the
traffic is hitting purple\_vs. The virtual server statistics should show
traffic being processed.

*Q8. What command(s) could you use to watch traffic hit the virtual
server and leave toward the pool?*

I would create two tcpdumps one on the client-side and the other on the
server-side. I would want to limit the captures to watch for my PC IP
address 10.1.10.6. You will need two terminal windows.

Terminal Window 1 (Client to BIG-IP)

**tcpdump -i client\_vlan -X -s0 host 10.1.10.6 and 10.1.10.105**

(This command will only watch client-side traffic between the PC and
virtual server. The -s0 command will dump the entire packet -X command
will dump hex and ascii code of the packet. You will be able to see the
HTTP request and response in the dump)

Terminal Window 2 (BIG-IP to Pool)

**tcpdump -i server\_vlan -X -s0 host 10.1.10.6**

(This command will only watch server-side traffic from the PC and to the
pool. The -s0 command will dump the entire packet -X command will dump
hex and ascii code of the packet. You will be able to see the HTTP
request and response in the dump)

*Q9. Did you see traffic hit the virtual server? Did you see BIG-IP send
traffic to a pool member?*

You should have seen traffic hit the virtual server in Window 1 and in
Window 2 BIG-IP should have picked a pool member and sent traffic to it.

*Q10. Did you see the return traffic? If there was no response, what is
your step?*

No, you did not received a response. Because the BIG-IP is not
the default gateway for the server, so the response went someplace else.

- In this case you will need to add a SNAT Pool or do SNAT Automap on the virtual server.
- You could modify the default gateway of the server to point to an IP address on the BIG-IP. The self IP address should be a floating IP in traffic\_group\_1 so that the default gateway for the server is still available upon failover.

Working with profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Did site work? Why not?*

You met with an SSL protocol error, we are coming in on port 443 but there is not certificate exchange.

*Q2. Did site work? What did the traffic look like on either side of the tcpdumps?*

Yes, the page should have been received.  In the tcpdump on the client side the request was encrypted. On the server side the request was readable.

*Q3. What was needed to add cookie persistence?*

http profile

*Q4. What is the name of the cookie inserted begin with?*

BIGipServerwww\_pool

Upgrading a BIG-IP Device Service Clusters (DSC)
------------------------------------------------

No questions in this section.

iApps and Analytics
-------------------

Create iApps Analytics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Q1. Did both pool members respond? Why?*

No, only one responded because cookie persistence was built using the
iApp

*Q2. Can you determine which page took the longest to load?*

If you select Latency > Page Load Time from the top bar you will find
/bigtext.html took longest.

*O3. Could you add the pool member? Why?*

No, because iApp strictness is on by default and the application can
only be changed by going to the iApp application and selecting
Reconfigure from the top bar
